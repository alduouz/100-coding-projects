# Project 11: Hello, Web! (Flask) — PRD

## 1. Overview
This project introduces Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, by creating a simple "Hello, World!" web app.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- The application must:
  - Define a `/` route.
  - Return the string `"Hello, World!"` as plain text when visited in a browser.
  - Be executable with `flask run` from the terminal.
- The source code must:
  - Be contained in a single file named `app.py`.
  - Include a comment attributing any code assistance from Claude.
- Submission must include:
  - `app.py`
  - Screenshot of browser with output.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Code must be clean, readable, and follow PEP8 conventions.
- App must start without errors using Flask’s built-in server.
- Response time should be under 100ms locally.

## 4. User Stories
**As a** beginner Python web developer,  
**I want** to run a simple Flask application locally,  
**So that** I can understand the basics of web routing and response handling.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- Visiting `http://localhost:5000/` displays "Hello, World!" in the browser.
- No additional routes or files are included.
- Code runs without syntax or runtime errors.
- Required screenshot is provided.

## 6. Notes
- This is a foundational web project — simplicity and clarity are the goals.
- No HTML templating is needed at this stage.
